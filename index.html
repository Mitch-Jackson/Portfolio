        <h2>Hi There!</h2>
          <p class="center">
            I'm Mitch, a software develober who lives in Redondo Beach, CA.
          <br>
          <br>
            I'm a huge geek who has always had a love for technology. As someone who has always taken a great effort in maintaining my own projects, you can garentee that:
          </p> 
            <ul> 
              <li>I will give you and your project the respect you deserve.</li>
              <li>I nerd out and give my all on every project I work on.
              <li>I will be honest and transparent about everything I am working on.
            </ul>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> I went to college at CSU Chico for health education. After I finished there I ended up continuing my education at UCLA Extension to become a licensed drug and alcohol counselor. For the next 8 years I worked in treatment centers all over Los Angeles before getting certified in life coaching and starting my private practice. 
          <br>
          <br>
          One big thing I have taken away from all my experince is that I love helping people AND I love coding. Once I began my journey at Thinkful to learn software devolpment I knew I had found my passion.
          <br>
          <br>
          I would be honored to assist you on your next project.
